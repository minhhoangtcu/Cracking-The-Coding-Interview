 * Certain applications require arbitrary precision arithmetic. One way to
 * achieve this is to use arrays to represent integers, e.g., with one digit per
 * array entry, with the most significant digit appearing first, and a negative
 * leading digit denoting a negative integer.
 * 
 * Write a program that takes two arrays representing integers, and returns an
 * integer representing their product.
