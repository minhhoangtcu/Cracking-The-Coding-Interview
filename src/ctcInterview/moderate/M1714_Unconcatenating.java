/**
 * You have just completed a lengthy document when you have an unfortunate
 * Find/Replace mishap. You have accidentally removed all spaces, punctuation,
 * and capitalization in the document. A sentence like
 * "I reset the computer. It still didn't boot!" would become
 * "iresetthecomputeritstilldidntboot." You figure that you can add back in the
 * punctation and capitalization later, once you get the individual words
 * properly separated. Most of the words will be in a dictionary, but some
 * strings, like proper names, will not.
 * 
 * Given a dictionary, design an algorithm to find the optimal way of
 * unconcatenating a sequence of words. In this case, "optimal" is defined to be
 * the parsing which minimizes the number of unrecognized sequences of
 * characters.
 * 
 * For example, the string "jesslookedjustliketimberbrother" would be optimally
 * parsed as "JESS looked just like TIM her brother". This parsing has seven
 * unrecognized characters, which we have capitalized for clarity.
