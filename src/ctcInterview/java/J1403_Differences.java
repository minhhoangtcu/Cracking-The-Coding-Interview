	/**
	 * Final is a key word used for variables, methods, and classes to state
	 * that they do not change. For example:
	 * - With primitive type: the var never change
	 * - With a reference: the var cannot point to any other thing in the heap
	 * - With a method: it cannot be overridden
	 * - With a class: it cannot be subclassed
	 * 
	 * Finally happens at the end of a try-catch block
	 * 
	 * Finalize is used by the garbage collector when no more references exist.
